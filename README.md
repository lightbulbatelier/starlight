# Welcome to Starlight!

Starlight serves as the foundation of the community-maintained RealArcade Games Guide service and, at the same time, the special skinning that reflects its service redirection.


### Status

Starlight is in active development, under the codename BlackBox. Templates and resources for creating new game pages are provided through the BlackBox SDK, a developer-focused patch for the RealArcade games client. Use of Expression Web 4 and Fireworks CS6 for modifying files is mandatory.


### Legal Agreements

The common framework where BlackBox is built upon is property of AstralSoup Design (ASD). Content generated in conjunction with the BlackBox SDK has its copyright specifications held by its contributors, who must acknowledge the creator of the platform.


### Acknowledgements

Starlight Game Guide services are possible thanks to the generous contributions of its volunteers and curators. AstralSoup Design wants to acknowledge Bowlerb, Dani (darxori), Marli, HMVocaloid and MatthewH12 for their efforts to make possible the development of this guide, thanks to the donation of RGS at the RealArcade Games Preservation Project.


### Contributions

If you want to be a contributor or curator, please associate with us at https://discord.gg/8CAu3NBbMt and go to the #BlackBox channel. A quick guide will aid you in the creation of new game pages.
