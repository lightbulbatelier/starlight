            <b>How does the GamePass Free Trial work?</b><br>
            This 30 day trial is absolutely free for all new members, and you may cancel at any time. The trial gives you full GamePass benefits for 30 days, <b>which includes 2 free games (Mah Jong Medley and an additional game of your choice)</b>. You'll also receive $5 discounts on all other game purchases. If you do not cancel your GamePass subscription before your 30 day trial period is over, you will be billed $9.99 for your second month. This billing will recur each month thereafter for as long as you are a GamePass member.<br />
            <br>
            <b>Can I cancel my GamePass subscription at any time?</b><br>
            Yes. Members can cancel their GamePass subscription at any time. GamePass benefits will continue through the last paid period. You can cancel your GamePass subscription or Trial subscription by contacting RealNetworks <a href="JavaScript:void(window.open('http://service.real.com/realarcade/'));">customer service</a>.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Which games can I buy using my GamePass credit? </b><br>
            You can choose from any game in our catalog up to $20. We have over 400 amazing game titles to choose from, and new games are added every month. As a GamePass member you get a game credit every month, and you can get $5 off any other game purchase. Download the games immediately and own them forever!<br>
            <br>
            <b>If I cancel my GamePass subscription, am I able to keep the games I bought with my credits?</b><br>
            The games you buy with your credits are yours to keep forever - even if you cancel your GamePass subscription. If you choose not to cancel your membership and pay for the second month, then decide to cancel, you'll get to keep the games you purchased with your credit in both the trial and in the additional paid month(s).<br>
            <br>
            <b>How do I purchase games using my monthly GamePass credit and the $5 discount? </b><br>
            Just browse the game catalog in RealArcade, try our great game demos, and then choose the game you'd like to own. Select the "Buy Full Version Now" option and after you login, you will be presented with the option to use your game credit or the $5 discount. After you use your monthly credit any additional games purchased in that month will receive a $5 discount automatically.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Does my monthly GamePass credit expire? </b><br>
            Your monthly GamePass credit will expire two months after the date granted.<br>
