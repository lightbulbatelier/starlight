            <b>How does the GamePass Free Trial work?</b><br>
            This 30-day trial is absolutely free for all new members, and you may cancel at any time.  The trial gives you full GamePass benefits for 30 days, which includes one free game of your choice, and $5 discounts on all other game purchases.  If you do not cancel your GamePass subscription before your 30-day trial period is over, you will be billed $4.99 for your second month. This billing will recur each month thereafter for as long as you are a GamePass member.<br>
            <br>
            <b>How much does GamePass cost?</b><br>
            Free for the first 30 days, then GamePass is only $4.99 a month. Members of GamePass get our RealArcade player, a free game Credit every month and $5 off every other game they buy.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Which games can I buy using my GamePass credit? </b><br>
            Members can choose from any game in our catalog up to $20.  We have over 300 amazing games to choose from, and new games are added every month. As a GamePass member, you get a game credit every month, and can get $5 off any other game purchases. Download the games immediately and own them forever!<br>
            <br>
            <b>If I cancel my GamePass subscription, am I able to keep the games I bought with my credits?</b><br>
            The games you buy with your credits are yours to keep forever when you are a paid member - even if you cancel your GamePass subscription.  Free trial members who cancel their 30-day trial subscription do not retain usage rights to the game that was purchased with the Credit.  If you choose not to cancel your membership and pay for the second month, then decide to cancel, you'll get to keep the games you purchased with your credit in both the 30-day trial and in the additional paid month(s).<br>
            <br>
            <b>How do I purchase games using my monthly GamePass credit and the $5 discount? </b><br>
            Just buy any game as you normally would through RealArcade. After you log in, you will be presented with the option to use your GamePass Credit or a $5.00 discount. After you use your monthly Credit, any additional games purchased that month will receive a $5.00 discount automatically.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Does my monthly GamePass credit expire? </b><br>
            Your monthly GamePass credit will expire two months after the date granted.<br>
			<br>
            <b>Is there a minimum commitment required when I sign up for GamePass? </b><br>
            There is no commitment for GamePass trial members. If you are not 100% satisfied with the GamePass service, contact RealNetworks <a class="link" href="http://switchboard.real.com/arcade/sites.html?ID=511" target="_blank">customer service</a> to cancel your membership before the 30-day trial is up and you will owe nothing.  If you do not cancel before the end of your trial, you will be billed $4.99 for your second month and this billing will recur each month thereafter until you cancel your subscription.<br>
			<br>
            <b>Can I cancel my GamePass subscription at any time? </b><br>
            Yes. Members can cancel their GamePass subscription at any time up to the day before your next billing cycle starts. The membership benefits of GamePass continue to the date that you have paid up to.  You can cancel your GamePass subscription or Trial subscription by contacting RealNetworks <a class="link" href="http://switchboard.real.com/arcade/sites.html?ID=511" target="_blank">customer service</a>.<br>
