			<p>The 25% discount sale applies to downloadable games purchased through RealArcade and distribution-partner branded Arcade software application clients and through the RealArcade website(s) and distribution-partner branded Arcade game websites. The 25% discount applies to the regular full price of the downloadable game(s) purchased and will be taken off of the regular sales price of the game(s) at the time of purchase in the online order path.</p>
			<p>The 25% discount sale will be active and in effect from approximately 3:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on September 6, 2006, until approximately 3:00 p.m. Pacific Standard Time on September 13, 2005.  Activation and de-activation times and dates of the 25% discount sale may be subject to change.  RealArcade and RealNetworks will not be required to honor the 25% discount either before the discount sale becomes active in the service on September 6, 2006, or after the discount sale officially ends on September 13, 2006. </p>
			<p>This 25% discount sale offer may not be combined with other coupons or discount offers, except for the standard discount on regular full price games available to eligible active GamePass subscription service members.</p>
			<p>Previously purchased games bought at regular price prior to the 25% discount sale period are not available for "price adjustments" or similar markdowns to the temporary discounted price during the sale. Previously purchased games may not be returned for refund and re-purchased at the discounted price during the sale period unless approved by a Customer Support professional and returned for a legitimate reason as outlined in the RealArcade terms of service.</p>
			<p>Customer returns of games purchased during the 25% discount sale period are subject to the standard rules and conditions of game returns as described in the RealArcade terms of service. A game return refund, if the customer is eligible for it, will be provided only for the purchase amount of the game, after applicable discounts.</p>
			<p>All other standard terms and conditions of the RealArcade service apply, as described in the RealArcade service End User License Agreement and the terms of service.</p>
